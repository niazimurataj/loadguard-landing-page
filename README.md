# Loadguard Landing Site

Loadguard is a container security solution that I built to solve a problem my family business had. This problem is costing us millions and, as a low margin business, it's existential. Further, clickbait sites have capitalized on it - and banks have debanked us because of this. 

If there was ever a pain point for a business, it'd be this.

This is my attempt to communicate what we do. This will plug into a dashboard.
